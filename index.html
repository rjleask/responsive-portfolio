            <p>Thank you in advance for taking the time to look at my portfolio.
                <br> I very much wish that when I was younger I could have stumbled upon a simple line of code that translated the heart's desires into perfectly understandable meanings for the brain (don't we all, right?). No matter though, I'm quite sure there will be an app for it, or Python will have a library for it soon! My way here began at UNH where I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Sciences- it's here where that line of code could have saved me some time. I took some interesting classes in C++ and Arv view GIS that sparked a small untranslatable interest in my heart that would lay dormant for a few years. I worked as an Environmental Consultant in Denver and then worked in Machining and Design. It wasn't until I took my first online programming classes in Python and made my first functions that I became aware of this spark. Since then, I have moved to front end with a pep in my step, and delved into JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and have been expanding from there. I'm very excited about where I'm headed. I've fixed my line of code (forgot a closing bracket on my media query...) and hope to land a position in the field soon!
